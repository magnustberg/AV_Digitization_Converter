This script is used to create either a:
1) FFV1 MKV master file and H264 MP4 access file from an uncompressed AVI file
2) MP3 access file from a WAV file

The application will deposit the master and access copies in a new directory under their respective "master" and "access directories and then bag the files according to the [Library of Congress BAGIT standard](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2019/04/bagit-at-the-library-of-congress/). The script assumes that you have a corresponding QCTools report when processing video. This was developed for a particular context within my library and may not be applicable to other contexts and is provided as is without warranty.

If you are working in a non-profit and/or cultural heritage context and would like to see further development, or would like an executable of this script, you can [contact me separately](https://utm.library.utoronto.ca/contact/magnus-berg).
