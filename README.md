This script is used to create a FFV1 MKV master file, H264 MP4 access file, and bag the files according to the [Library of Congress BAGIT standard](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2019/04/bagit-at-the-library-of-congress/). This was developed for a particular context within my library and may not be applicable to other contexts and is provided as is without warranty.

If you are working in a non-profit and/or cultural heritage context and would like to see further development, or would like an executable of this script, you can [contact me separately](https://utm.library.utoronto.ca/contact/magnus-berg).
